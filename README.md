Assessment Project for Clyde Conservation

Brief:

Clyde Conservation is a small, but expanding conservation organization with links to Clyde University. It is a non-profit 
making charitable organization which specialises in mammals, birds and reptiles. As well as carrying out invaluable research 
with the animals at the organisation, they also provide sanctuary for animals categorised as endangered animals. They provide 
educational support to schools and colleges and give lectures and talks to many different organisations. The current system 
is part manual, part computerised. It is very difficult to keep track of which Keeper is looking after which cage â€“ some 
keepers are given too many cages to look after.  Also, some of the animal details get lost or are not updated correctly. Clyde 
conservation would like you to design and implement a new computer system that will help them keep track of all the animals in 
the organisation, and the allocation of keepers to cages.  Clerk details, financial details will not be part of the system yet.
